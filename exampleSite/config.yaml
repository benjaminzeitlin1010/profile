      I am currently taking a pause on my Masters in Computer Science at Virginia Tech to pursue a career. I plan to attend my masters in the coming year. I received my Bachelors of Science in Computational Modeling and Data Analytics in May 2024, where I then pursued my Masters starting in June 2024 until December 2024. I specialize in data analysis, software development, and database management. I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve complex challenges. I have experience working on projects in various fields, including biostatistics, web development, and environmental data analysis. I hope to pursue a career in helping people with my data analytic skills in a non-profit manner.
